# Client Applications

The `clients/` directory contains frontend applications and client-facing code for the Zeiro platform.

## File Naming Conventions
- All file names should use lowercase with hyphens for separation (kebab-case)
- Component files should be named descriptively: `navigation.tsx`, `dashboard-layout.tsx`, `user-profile.tsx`
- Avoid PascalCase for file names, use kebab-case instead
- Page files follow Next.js conventions: `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`

## Component Structure
- Components should be organized in logical folders under `src/components/`
- Layout-related components go in `src/components/layout/`
- UI components go in `src/components/ui/`
- Feature-specific components go in `src/components/[feature-name]/`

## React Patterns
- Use "use client" directive only when necessary (client-side interactivity)
- Prefer server components when possible
- Keep state management close to where it's needed
- Use proper component composition patterns

## Marketing Site

The Marketing client in [clients/marketing](mdc:clients/marketing) contains:
- The main marketing website
- Landing pages
- Documentation for public users
- Contact and sign-up forms

## Dashboard

The Dashboard client in [clients/dashboard](mdc:clients/dashboard) contains:
- Database management interface
- Query builder and execution
- Analytics and monitoring
- User settings and preferences
